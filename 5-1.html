                Algorithms are reconstructing us, based on what we like, what we wear, even how we speak—exposed to a curated feed that curates different versions of us, shaping a system of not who we are but who we should be. Under this homogenized identity we consume the same aesthetics, repeating the same jokes, vibing to the same dopamine loops as millions of others. Decoded: Designing Authenticity Chapter 5.1 dives into this very question- how much agency do we have to determine our identity and authenticity in this invisible system that's actually exploiting our choices based off our data.

I think there was a time in which culture kind of was like a mirror that reflected the moment of the society.

"We're, we're being homogenized. Because we're consuming, I think there's a very homogenous moment. I think a lot of us are consuming the same things. And we're, and the piece of culture is dictating to people in a way that is more, the power is more with the companies that are producing than the consumers. I think there was a time in which culture kind of was like a mirror that reflected the moment of the society. And now it's, it's the mirror has kind of like smashed apart and very much ingrained with our lives. And it's also dictating to us who we are, what we are, how we think."
